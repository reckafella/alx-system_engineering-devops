* A README.md file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your Puppet manifests must pass puppet-lint version 2.1.1 without any errors
* Your Puppet manifests must run without error
* Your Puppet manifests first line must be a comment explaining what the Puppet manifest is about
* Your Puppet manifests files must end with the extension .pp
* Files will be checked with Puppet v3.4
