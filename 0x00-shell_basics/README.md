In this project, we have scripts that perform various shell tasks.

This README file lists each file with a short description of the task it is performing.
1. 0-current_working_directory -- prints the current working directory
2. 1-listit -- Displays the contents of the current directory
3. 2-bring_me_home -- a script that changes the working directory to the userâ€™s home directory.
4. 3-listfiles -- Display current directory contents in a long format
